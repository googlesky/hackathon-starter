## Setup Instructions

### Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-directory>
  ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### Production Environment
1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-directory>
  ```

2. **Checkout the Production Branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout production/tags
  ```

4. **Change config.yaml & .env files**
  - Update the `config.yaml` file with the required configuration.
  - Create a `.env` file and set the required environment variables.

3. **Run deploy.sh Script:**
  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

## Configuration Options

- **environment**: Specifies the environment in which the application is running. Common values are `dev` for development, `staging` for pre-production, and `prod` for production. In this case, it's set to `dev`.

- **app_name**: The name of the application. This is often used for logging, monitoring, and display purposes. Here, it's set to `hackathon-starter`.

- **app_url**: The URL where the application is hosted. This is useful for generating links or for use in API calls. The provided URL is `https://1devops.io`.

- **images_registry**: The container image registry where your Docker images are stored. In this case, it's set to `ghcr.io`, which stands for GitHub Container Registry.

- **images_namespace**: The namespace within the image registry. This helps in organizing and managing images. Here, it's set to `googlesky`.

- **images_tag**: The tag used for the Docker images. Tags are used to version images. In this case, it's set to `commit_sha`, which likely means the tag will be the commit SHA of the codebase.

- **app_config**: The path to the application's configuration file. This file typically contains environment variables and other settings. Here, it's set to `.env`.

- **kubernetes_namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace where the application will be deployed. Namespaces in Kubernetes are used to divide cluster resources between multiple users. In this case, it's set to `hackathon-starter`.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- **Server Not Starting:**
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`.
  - Check if the correct environment variables are set.
  - Verify the port is not in use by another application.

- **Database Connection Issues:**
  - Confirm the `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set.
  - Ensure the database server is running and accessible.

- **Build Failures:**
  - Check for syntax errors or missing dependencies.
  - Ensure all required environment variables are set before building.

## Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables:** 
  - Never hardcode sensitive information in the codebase. Use environment variables for configuration.
  
- **Dependencies:**
  - Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
  - Use tools like `npm audit` to check for security issues in dependencies.

- **Access Control:**
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - Ensure sensitive routes and data are protected.

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest using appropriate encryption techniques.
